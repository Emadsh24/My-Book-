#app_book
On the home page, the user will see a text field to search for books. After pressing the search button, if books are found, they will see a list of books, with their title and description. For each list, there will be a button that will allow the user to add a book to their favorites. The favorite books will be saved locally.

One of the challenges in having to deal with different form factors is the way you use the space on the screen. So, we will add a small tweak to the app. If the screen is "small", such as in a smartphone, the user will see ListView; otherwise, they will see a table.
